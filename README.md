# SteelEngine
This Project is a Game Engine that we have to create in Programming 4 in the Howest University: DAE.

You Control the player with the DPad on the Controller, you can collect the Emeralds to get points.
And you can dig through the world.

I did not like the combination of States and Commands. The Command pattern is a bit to complex for this project and makes stuff more complicated.

The projekt is done, but I discovered that I probably not become an engine developer, therefore I currently don't have any interest of finishing the game, extent, improve or fix the flaws in the engine code.
